This file includes the complete source (Compile.zip) and listings (listings.doc).

In addition to a word doc that describes how to implement the examples (Compile Controller Guide.doc), you can also find a PDF that shows how VB makes an EXE (HowVBMakesEXE.pdf) and another PDF that walks you through the basics of using the Compile Controller (Using Flowchart.pdf).

There are four example directories and a directory containing the source code for the add-in. The add-in and all the examples have both source code and compiled binaries. The guide to doing the examples is saved both in Word97 and text format in the directory containing this file.

The add-in itself, called CompileController.dll, and its installer are in the add-in source directory. You may want to copy these binaries to another location before installing the add-in.
